## Introduction

*Rob the robot* ü§ñ: Bip boop bip boop boop... Now we have a functional backend but there is no interface who allow us to use it, so we finished the half of the work ! We need to implement it now or we will die... lost in the galaxy... forever... It‚Äôs up to you ! 


## What is a React ?

Today, there are many technologies available in order to create a website.
The React library is one of the most used and popular, having a very important place in the world and being carried by Facebook.

Using TypeScript against JavaScript is the best thing that could happen to you.

TypeScript is :
* üí™ More reliable
* üéØ More explicit thanks to its types
* ‚ÜîÔ∏è TypeScript and JavaScript are practically interchangeable

#### Start by documenting yourself :
* [React](https://fr.reactjs.org/)
* [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
* [CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/fr/docs/Web/CSS)
* [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/)

## Step 0 - Setup

Before starting the workshop, make sure you've completed all the steps of the [setup](./SETUP.md).

## Some precision...

This part focuses on the frontend of your project. This is an early and broad area. But today we are going to focus on three main areas: the visuals, the user experience, and the code architecture.

That's why we will guide you throughout this part, by proposing you some visuals as an example, but be careful, this is only a recommendation. Feel free using personal artistic choice.

## Step 1 - Connection management

#### Let's start with the foundations.

First, you should know that the whole architecture is provided to you with some small pieces of code.
> ‚ö†Ô∏è It is important to respect the following architecture for this workshop.

#### So let's get started! üí™

The **router** of your pages is a component that is very high in your [_DOM_](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Document_Object_Model), that is to say that the rest of the components you will create will necessarily be one of its children more or less directly.

The **router** will allow you to call the desired component according to the page requested in the **URL** thanks to the `path` passed in parameter of each `<Route />`.

For example, we have already implemented a _Hello World page_ ([here](http://localhost:3000/hello)) but also a page managing the _404 error_ ([here](http://localhost:3000/404)).

> üëÅÔ∏è Take a look at these two pages and _the code_ ([here](./front/src/pages/Router/index.tsx)) to better understand your router.

`src/pages/Connection/index.tsx`

Now that you understand how it works, you will have to create a new route.

Your route must call the `Connection` component with the path `/login`.

Congratulations, you have just finished your first step !

Now, we are going to attack the heart of the project, the first step will be to implement a connection page and that can be either a `login` page or a `register` page depending on the URL.

Your two components must be called from your `Connection` component, for the latter we have chosen to provide you with a good part of the code, so you will only have to modify the children of the `ConnectionForm` tag.

Your role is to make it call either the :
- `Login` component if `pageType === 'login'` 
or
- `SignUp` if `pageType === 'register'`.

**This also means that you have to link this with your router.**

### The `Login` component

_**Now go to the `Login` component.**_

This one is quite simple, you just need to implement a form containing an input for the Email address, a password input and a login button.

> Be careful with each styled component that you will implement, it is important to keep in mind a responsiveness dimension. A good way to test this is to open your web console.

When a user presses the login button, you must call the function `postLogin` to connect with your backend.

You will have to implement a form without using the classic HTML tag, in our case we will use simple HTML `<input>` tags with the following `props`:
- value
- type
- placeholder
- onChange

For each input you will have to create a state to manage its value.
[docs](https://fr.reactjs.org/docs/hooks-state.html)

In this case, you must have these four variables :
- `emailValue`
- `setEmailValue`
- `passwordValue`
- `setPasswordValue`

The value of each input will correspond to the value of its state, which will be modified
via its setter function which will be called by the `onChange` property.

> The `onChange` property takes a function as parameter. You have two choices:
- Create a constant variable containing a useCallBack which itself contains an arrow function. (_This should be your default choice if the action does not fit in a single line of code._)
- Or you can create an arrow function directly in the `onChange` property. (_This choice is acceptable if your function fits in a single line._)

For the other props mentioned above, it is trivial to find their value.

> To summarize this task, you must :
Add to the Login component a form allowing to connect by filling it with your email and password after pressing the login button. These components must be responsive and must call your backend functions.

- [Input docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/fr/docs/Web/HTML/Element/Input)
- [Responsive Design](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/CSS_layout/Responsive_Design)

### The `Register` component

_**Now go to the `Register` component.**_

This one is similar to the previous component, you are asked almost the same thing.
But this time you will have to add some **extra fields**.

You must implement the **four fields** below:
- Email
- Password
- Password confirmation
- Wallet

You will still need to implement your form, using States.

The only difference is that when you click on the register button, you will have to
register the user, but also create a `Smart Contract` for them.

To do this you need to look at and call the functions `putRegister` and `postSmartContract`.

> Let's do a quick recap of what we have at this point. For now, your users can log in from the `/login` URL with their email address and password. But also create an account if needed and directly connect it to their wallet via the URL `signup`.

## Step 2 : Your dashboard.

_**Take a look at the `Dashboard` component.**_

We land in your users space. In fact, this is your first step. You need to get your users to this page once they've logged in.

> We also remind you that at the bottom of each step documentation is available.

The idea is to create a space where each user will be able to visualize all his NFTs, but also to interact with them. From this page it should also be possible to `Log out`.

In order to do this, add a button allowing you to `Log out` in the `TopBar`.

Perfect ! It is now time to create your button to add a new NFT. This button must look like this (IMAGE).

You must create this button in the component `ViewNft` in the `NftManager`.

When a user clicks on this button, you must set the page status to `create`.

When this is implemented, you should have a white page with your topbar. This means that you are on your creation page.

This page must allow you to upload a new NFT.

In order to do this, it must propose a form to the user, containing the following informations :

- name
- nftName
- description
- receiverAddress
- image (you have to find a way to import an image and to transform it into a base64 buffer)

By the way, after the user has fill all his datas, you need to call the function `postUploadNft`.

You will also notice that this function take the exact same parameters that the ones asked previously.

Once the user created his NFT, you must set the page status to `view`;

#### A little help with documentation :

## Step 3: Display all your NFTs

Now that you know how to create NFTs. It would be very useful to display them all.

To do this go back to the `ViewNft` component in the `NftManager`.

After your create button, you will have to add all the user's NFTs.

You need to use the `getNft` function, it allows you to retrieve the user's nft.

Look at its return type, and display each element of the array in your component. The idea would be to make an grid of images.

Ideally it should be positioned like this (IMAGE).

In order to do this you will have to use the `map` method of an array.

To retrieve your image find out how to turn a base64 buffer into a `HtmlImageElement`.
